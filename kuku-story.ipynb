      "Chapter One - A New Beginning\n",
      "Michael was the type who always had a plan for everything. He would go to college, get a good job, buy a nice house, and raise a family with his wife. That’s how he saw life – one step at a time. But as soon as he arrived in New York City, all of those plans went out the window.\n",
      "He had just finished unpacking his last box when the doorbell rang. Michael opened the door to find a young woman standing on his doorstep. She was wearing an oversized sweatshirt that hid most of her figure, but she was unmistakably beautiful. Her long black hair fell freely down her back, and her big brown eyes seemed to sparkle.\n",
      "\"Um... hello,\" Michael said, feeling slightly flustered by her sudden appearance.\n",
      "\"Hi, sorry to bother you,\" she said hesitantly. \"I'm looking for an apartment in this building. Is this apartment 7B?\"\n",
      "\"Yes, yes it is!\" Michael exclaimed, relieved that they were on the same page. \"Come on in.\"\n",
      "The woman stepped inside, and Michael closed the door behind her. As they walked towards the living room, he noticed her carrying several boxes, which seemed to be filled with random items such as old newspapers, books, and clothes. Curious about what she was doing here, he decided to strike up a conversation.\n",
      "\"I see you've already moved in,\" Michael commented, pointing to the boxes.\n",
      "\"Yeah,\" she replied with a small smile. \"I moved in yesterday. I didn't think it would take so much work to unpack everything.\"\n",
      "Michael laughed softly. \"Welcome to the Big Apple. Sometimes things don’t go as planned.\"\n",
      "The woman looked up at him, her gaze locking onto his. There was something about her that made him feel like he wanted to know everything about her. Maybe it was her quiet confidence, or maybe it was the way her lips curved into a soft smile whenever she spoke. Either way, Michael felt an inexplicable connection to her.\n",
      "\"Thank you,\" she said, placing the boxes gently on the coffee table. \"So, why are you still unpacking? Shouldn’t you be at work?\"\n",
      "\"Oh,\" Michael chuckled, realizing he hadn't thought about returning to his job today. \"No, not really. My boss is giving me some time off to settle in. I mean, I have a lot to do, but after yesterday's chaos, I figured I deserved a break.\"\n",
      "She smiled warmly, her eyes twinkling with amusement. \"You’re welcome to join me if you'd like. I promise we won't be unpacking all day!\"\n",
      "Michael couldn't help but laugh again. \"That sounds perfect.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter Two - Unfolding Secrets\n",
      "Over the next few weeks, Michael found himself spending more and more time with the mysterious young woman. They explored the city together, discovering hidden gems in neighborhoods where neither of them had been before. During these outings, Michael learned that her name was Emily, and she had recently returned from traveling abroad. While she shared stories of her adventures, she remained tight-lipped about where exactly she’d been, leaving Michael intrigued but also curious.\n",
      "One evening, while sharing dinner at a quaint café near Central Park, Emily finally revealed a secret that surprised Michael. “You see,” she began, twirling her spaghetti noodles expertly between her fingers, “before moving here, I spent four years working as an undercover agent.”\n",
      "Michael choked on his wine, spilling half of it across the table. After clearing his throat, he asked, “Really? An agent?”\n",
      "Emily nodded solemnly. “Yeah. I worked for a major international agency. It wasn’t easy, but it was necessary.”\n",
      "Michael tried to digest this information. “Wow… so you’ve been in danger then?”\n",
      "“Yes,” Emily admitted, her voice barely above a whisper. “More times than I can count. That’s part of the reason I needed to leave. I’m not sure how safe my family will be anymore.”\n",
      "Her vulnerability hit Michael hard; he wanted nothing more than to protect her. However, he knew better than to push too hard, especially considering their new relationship.\n",
      "“I’m so sorry that happened to you,” Michael whispered, reaching over to squeeze her hand reassuringly. “But now you're here, and we’ll keep each other safe.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter Three - Testing Waters\n",
      "With Emily's background revealed, Michael faced a dilemma. How could he maintain his protective nature without making her uncomfortable? He decided to take things slowly and show genuine interest in her past. One afternoon, as they strolled along Riverside Drive, he mentioned, “You know, you never told me about your travels. What places did you visit?”\n",

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`.
